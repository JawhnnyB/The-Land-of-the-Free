# The Land of the Free

This repository contains simulation files for nuclear reactor projects using open-source tools MOOSE and OpenMC.

Primarily this is a small representation of my project files, I have each reactor in different formats, 
I also have them in CASMO-4E and MCNP except those are restricted due to export controls by the U.S. Goverment

## Structure
- `MOOSE_Projects/`: Input files and outputs for MOOSE simulations.
- `OpenMC_Projects/`: XML input files and outputs for OpenMC simulations.
- `AI_Projects/`: AI training data and models.
- `scripts/`: Automation scripts.
- `american_eagle.txt`: ASCII art displayed on terminal startup.
