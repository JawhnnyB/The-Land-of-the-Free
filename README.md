The Land of the Free
This repository contains simulation files for nuclear reactor projects using open-source tools like MOOSE and OpenMC. It serves as a small representation of my project files, with each reactor modeled in different formats. Note that simulations in CASMO-4E and MCNP are restricted due to U.S. Government export controls and are not included here.
Disclaimer: All rights to the underlying simulation tools and frameworks (including OpenMC, MCNP, MOOSE/Cardinal, and related libraries) are reserved by their respective owners and developers. This repository uses these tools solely for modeling advanced reactors and does not claim any ownership or rights over them. For official documentation and source code, please refer to the following repositories:

This project is for educational and research purposes only, complying with all applicable licenses and export regulations.
Structure

MOOSE_Projects/: Input files and outputs for MOOSE simulations (including Cardinal for multiphysics coupling).
OpenMC_Projects/: XML input files (materials.xml, geometry.xml, settings.xml) and outputs for OpenMC simulations.
AI_Projects/: AI training data and models related to reactor optimization or analysis.
scripts/: Automation scripts for generating and running simulations (e.g., Python scripts for OpenMC, MCNP, and Cardinal).
american_eagle.txt: ASCII art displayed on terminal startup.
